// any content the user writes above or below the markers is preserved across
// re-runs. The file has no YAML front matter (Copilot convention).
//
// Behaviour by file state (see configureCopilotInstructions in leanctx.ts):
//   - Missing or empty: default-create. The always-on guidance is the value
//     Lanyard ships; a fresh file has no user content to protect.
//   - Exists with the current managed markers: refresh in place (idempotent).
//   - Exists with legacy markers (<!-- lanyard:lean-ctx-rules:start/end -->):
//     strip and replace with the current managed block (documented upgrade).
//   - Exists with user content and no Lanyard markers: prompt the user
//     before appending the managed block. Non-interactive mode (no TTY)
//     defaults to yes with a loud warning so automation keeps working.

// review — Lanyard's own skill: dispatches the

//   five parallel review lenses (correctness, security, spec, tests,
//   design) and merges the findings into a severity-ordered report. Loaded

//   subagent (`ticket-to-pr-implementer`) to write code and pass test/lint
//   gates, then a PR-creator subagent (`ticket-to-pr-pr-creator`) to push
//   the branch and open the PR via `gh`. No worktree, no planning phase —
//   straight from Jira key to opened PR. Requires the Atlassian MCP, the

//   `ai-readiness-reporter` custom agent. Runtime: `npx -y
//   github:microsoft/agentrc readiness --json` (auto-downloads on first

//   skill (probes via `npx --no-install` to detect presence; absent or

//   Note: not to be confused with the `acreadiness-generate-instructions`
//   skill in the same upstream repo — that one writes
//   `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, which is the file Lanyard manages

//     `reviewer-tests` / `reviewer-design`). Each runs in isolated
//     context (`user-invocable: false`) so findings are independent and
//     unanchored.
//   - `ticket-to-pr` workflow (write): the `ticket-to-pr` user-invocable
//     coordinator dispatches two subagents sequentially —
//     `ticket-to-pr-implementer` (code + test/lint gate + commit) and
//     `ticket-to-pr-pr-creator` (`git push` + `gh pr create`). Both are
//     `user-invocable: false`; the coordinator is the only entry point.
