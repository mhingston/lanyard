 *   - **File exists with the current managed markers**: refresh the block in
 *     place. Idempotent — no prompt.
 *   - **File exists with legacy markers** (`<!-- lanyard:lean-ctx-rules:start/end -->`):
 *     strip them and replace with the current managed block. This is the
 *     documented upgrade migration for older Lanyard versions — no prompt.
 *   - **File exists with user content and no Lanyard markers at all**: prompt
 *     the user before appending the managed block. This is the only path
